- **Cross-platform support**: Windows, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), and Linux binaries
- **Memory safety**: Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time guarantees

#### üõ†Ô∏è Core Features
- **Multi-format EXIF support**: JPEG, TIFF, DNG, and 20+ RAW camera formats
- **Equipment management**: Complete database for cameras, lenses, films, photographers, and setups
- **Interactive CLI**: Modern terminal interface with colored output and intuitive navigation
- **Batch processing**: Recursive directory scanning with progress feedback
- **ISO override**: Support for push/pull processing with custom ISO values

#### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Robust error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with detailed feedback
- **Type safety**: Strong typing throughout the application prevents runtime errors
- **Modular architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined modules
- **Comprehensive testing**: 45+ unit and integration tests ensuring reliability
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing, formatting, and linting with GitHub Actions

#### üé® User Experience
- **Colored output**: Enhanced readability with syntax highlighting
- **Progress indicators**: Real-time feedback during batch operations
- **Clear navigation**: Intuitive menu system with easy-to-understand options
- **Flexible input**: Support for quoted paths, spaces, and various path formats

#### üì¶ Development Quality
- **Clippy compliance**: Strict linting rules ensure code quality
- **Formatted code**: Consistent formatting with rustfmt
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and README
- **Security**: Forbids unsafe code and follows Rust security best practices

### Breaking Changes
- **Complete API rewrite**: This is not compatible with previous JavaScript versions
- **Configuration format**: New JSON-based configuration system
- **Command-line interface**: Updated CLI structure and options

### Migration
Users upgrading from previous versions will need to reconfigure their equipment database, as the underlying data format has changed to support the new Rust implementation.
